                What is financial planning?

             <p class="sump">
                Financial Planning is the comprehensive evaluation of your current financial position and future goals to chalk-out a time-bound strategy for the future. It involves assessing your financial position, identifying leakages, acknowledging your goals, assessing your risk profile, designing a suitable asset allocation plan and laying down a strategy timeline to accomplish the goals.

             <p class="sump">

             <p class="sump">
                The best financial planner is one that not only studies you but understands you. Scanning your profile and suggesting you a popular investment option (yes yes, that one) is easy, but understanding your profile and recommending unpopular hacks that are perfect for you is what separates the best from the rest. Guess what? Recipe is here to change your definition of the ‘best financial planner’.

                Value Investing is an investment technique that involves filtering stocks that are trading below their intrinsic (true) value.

                The best investment course not only tells you investment theories but also illustrates how it can be applied in real-life scenarios. The market rewards not someone who has the best theory rather the one who can apply even the simplest of techniques practically. That is where Quest comes in and helps you understand investment strategies along with their contextual applications.

                How to learn to invest in mutual funds?
              </summary>
             <p class="sump">
                Mutual fund investment, by its very nature, is subject to market risks, which is why it is a tough task to select funds that deliver positive returns, let alone beating the average. While mutual fund investing seems a cakewalk, most people don’t understand what’s beyond the obvious in fund-picking. Quest by Finology introduces you to the basics of how to select the right mutual fund and what they won’t tell you about it!

              </summary>
             <p class="sump">
                Investing, in general, is very subjective. Which is a good fund depends mostly on your financial profile, goals and risk appetite. The key to good fund-picking lies in the proper assessment of one’s financial profile. That is why you should use intelligent tools available in Recipe by Finology that understands you and suggests not only good funds but also tells you the risks associated and your ideal allocation to those funds. Clever, isn’t it?

             <p class="sumpe">
                Honestly, this is a very subjective question. Firstly, you will have to figure out a strategy to manage your spendings, savings and investments at the same time. Secondly, you need to assess your profile, your goals, your risk appetite and then, find a suitable investment strategy to begin with. Too complex, right? Don’t worry, Recipe will do all of this for you!
